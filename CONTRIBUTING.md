# Contributing to COCA Framework Skill

Thanks for your interest in contributing! COCA is intentionally lightweight, and we'd like to keep it that way.

## Ways to Contribute

### Methodology Improvements
The COCA framework itself (Context, Outcome, Constraints, Assertions) can always be refined. If you've found better questions to ask, clearer ways to explain a section, or improvements to the prompts in `SKILL.md`, we'd love to hear about it.

### Examples
Real-world COCA specs help people understand the framework. Consider contributing examples for:
- API design
- Mobile features
- Infrastructure changes
- Data migrations
- UI/UX features
- DevOps workflows

### Documentation
Better explanations, edge case guidance, and tips for getting the most out of COCA.

### Translations
Localized versions of the skill for non-English speakers.

## How to Contribute

1. **Open an issue first** for significant changes. Let's discuss before you invest time coding.
2. **Fork the repo** and create a branch for your changes.
3. **Keep PRs focused** - one improvement per PR.
4. **Test manually** - run the skill and make sure it works as expected.
5. **Submit your PR** with a clear description of what changed and why.

## What We Won't Accept

- **Bloat** - COCA's value is in its simplicity. "One page, not fifty."
- **Implementation details in the framework** - COCA is about *what* to build, not *how*. Keep it technology-agnostic.
- **Scope creep** - Features that turn this into something other than a spec-building tool.

## Code of Conduct

Be respectful. We're all here to build better software.

## Questions?

Open an issue. We're happy to help.
